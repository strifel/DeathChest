# DeathChest
A Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot plugin, which saves your items in a chest on death.
This requires you (not in creative) to have a chest in your inventory which can be used.

### Simple:
- There are no permissions
- There are no config files
- Just drop the jar in your plugin directory (Jar can be found in releases tab)

 -> Made for "simple survival servers"
